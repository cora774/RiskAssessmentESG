# ESG Risk Assessment of the S&P 500

## Project Overview: 
This analysis evaluates the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risk scores of companies within the S&P 500, identifying which sectors, industries, and companies face the highest ESG-related risks. 


## Dataset:  
(2023) S&P 500 ESG Risk Ratings [Data set]. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/3660201

## Methodology:
- Dataset exploration: ESG related dataset was the goal. Found dataset with categorical risk data. Owner Pritish Dugar updates dataset yearly. 
- Started rough draft in R studio coding with R. Exploratory data analysis, little structure to the project initially. 
- Process resulted in cleaning dataset externally in Excel for project needs
- Transferred project to Jupyter Notebook & Python for aesthetics
- Manipulated clean dataset to match the needs of each visualization
- Showcase visualizations of all kinds: tables, color maps, bar and line charts, a density estimate graph, boxplots.
- Analyzed insights from visualizations in description boxes. Drew on education and background in sustainability and economics.
- Used HTML to clean up the visual presentation of the project in PDF form.


## Key Insights:
- Social Risk scores are the most prominent contributor to overall ESG risk across the S&P 500, followed by governance and environmental risks.
- The Industrials, Financial Services, Healthcare, and Energy sectors are the most significant contributors to high ESG risk scores.
- Outliers (companies with the highest individual ESG risk scores) show that environmental risks have the most extreme values, primarily driven by companies in oil & gas, while governance risks are most severe in financial assets & banks.
- Interestingly, company size (measured by the number of full-time employees) does not show a reliable correlation with total ESG risk scores, indicating that sector and industry are better predictors of ESG risk.
